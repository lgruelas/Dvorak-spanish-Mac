# Dvorak-spanish-Mac

Dvorak keyboard layout for spanish speakers.

## Why is this necessary?

For some reason, Mac doesn't have a built in dvorak layout for spanish speakers, and is hard to find one that is more or less similar to the one of xorg that is available in linux.

## Public

If you are a Linux user that is used to do `setxkbmap 'dvorak' 'es'` this is for you.

## Instalation

Just clone the repo into your local and paste the content into `/Library/Keyboard\ Layout/dvorak-spanish.bundle/
